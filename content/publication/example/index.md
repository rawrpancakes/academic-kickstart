abstract: Facilitating the establishment of native pioneer plant species on mine
  tailings with inherent metal and/or acid tolerance is important to speed up
  natural succession at minimal cost, especially in remote areas where
  phytoremediation can be labor intensive. We investigated vegetation community
  dynamics after ∼48 years of succession along two legacy Ni–Cu mine tailings
  and waste rock deposits in the Sudbury Basin, Ontario, Canada with and without
  various site amendments (i.e. liming and fertilization) and planting.
  Metal/acid tolerant pioneer plants (Betula papyrifera, Populus tremuloides,
  Pohlia nutans) appeared to facilitate the establishment of less tolerant
  species. Conifers and nitrogen-fixers less tolerant to site conditions were
  planted at the fully amended (limed, fertilized, planted) mine tailings site
  in the 1970s, but conifers were not propagating at the site or facilitating
  understory succession. The planted nitrogen-fixing leguminous species Lotus
  corniculatus was, however, associated with increased diversity. These findings
  have implications for long-term reclamation strategies in acidic mine waste
  deposits utilizing native species, as primary colonizing tree species are only
  recently emerging as candidates for phytoremediation.

summary: Novelty statement The potential for native species to act as
  facilitators for vegetation colonization has rarely been investigated on
  tailings, despite wide use in remediation of less toxic sites. This study
  provides a retrospective of over 40 years of plant growth following initial
  treatment of toxic tailings. We observed that regardless of tailings
  geochemical conditions, acid/metal tolerant pioneer plants were facilitating
  ecological succession on acidic Ni-Cu mine tailings sites.
